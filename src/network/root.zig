//! A serialized owner advances bounded protocol state machines. Engines own protocol
//! machinery; transports connect engines to sockets; drivers wait for readiness and
//! advance with fresh time. NetworkCore coordinates discovery, peer policy and Protocols.
//! The binding runtime owns the execution environment and host delivery.
//!
//! Scheduling vocabulary:
//! - Schedule describes immediate work and the earliest deadline. It owns no work.
//! - Turn is one bounded execution opportunity; Pass traverses a defined set of work.
//! - Cycle is a logical maintenance operation that may span turns.
//! - step performs one driver iteration, including waiting; advance uses supplied input
//!   and time; pump services pending work until blocked or limited by its budget.
//!
//! Decisions and configuration:
//! - Intent describes desired state; Demand gives targets; Hints are advisory inputs.
//! - State records execution; Selection names chosen work. A SelectedDial carries a
//!   reservation, so its owner must report the attempt's disposition.
//! - Options are construction inputs, Resolved contains derived settings, and Config
//!   holds enduring configuration. Options may contain required fields.
//! - Layout describes storage sizes and offsets. Plan describes a proposed operation;
//!   Prepared values belong to a preparation/commit contract documented by their owner.
//!
//! Storage and delivery:
//! - Table emphasizes indexed entries; Catalog retains identity knowledge; Registry
//!   tracks live instances; Pool manages reusable capacity; Store retains payloads.
//! - Slot names a reusable position, Entry its contents, and Record a domain value or
//!   bookkeeping object. A generational Handle identifies an incarnation of a slot.
//! - Result is an operation's return value; Outcome its disposition; Progress records
//!   advancement and continuation; Event reports a fact; Completion answers a pending
//!   operation or stage. A completion need not end its enclosing stream or host task.
//!
//! Qualify names at domain boundaries. Protocol and JavaScript terminology keeps its
//! domain meaning, including consensus slots and epochs and Promise settlement.
